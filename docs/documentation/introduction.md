# Introduction

Well hello there!
I guess you are programming enthusiast, or a future game designer, or simply a diehard ZUN's worshipper drowning in a sea full of Gensokyo lore and have interest on making games (from scratch). Or possibly both? Who knows. But anyway, by stepping a foot in this area, I'm sure you definitely want to contribute something into this humble project, whether by coding, creating art assets, making music, or just simply seeing what on the heck of the whole world is going on right here.

Welcome to **Touhou Multiplayer Connectivity Project** aka **TOHOMC Project**. This project is created with an ultimate goal to, by the name speaks itself, bringing the full and customizable multiplayer experience to this life-long bullet-hell series. Unless you are fine with playing alone, this is a great opportunity for you to try out this ambigious project, and possibly contribute your improvements for the project. And yes, feel free to create your own variant from this project (but please, always remember to credit the source!)
