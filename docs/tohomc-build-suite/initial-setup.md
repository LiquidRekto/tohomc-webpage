# Initial setup
First of all, for building the project, we assume that you have already had **Visual Studio 2022** installed, with component **Desktop development with C++** installed.

Since the game is made using the **Vulkan API**, you might want to install the [**Vulkan SDK**](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/) as well. This is to make sure you have got the tools for the shader compilation, but also possibly other things you might need from the SDK.

After you met with the requirements, go ahead and clone the repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/LiquidRekto/tohomc-build-suite
```

After you have cloned everything, open the solution file then **Rebuild** all of the included projects.

```cpp
int main()
{
    return 0;
}
```

```python
def main():
    print("Hello world!")
```
