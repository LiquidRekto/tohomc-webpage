# So... how the heck does this thing started?

Simply, I've just realized the potential of this ....

There's singleplayer mode, offline PvP (max 2 people) modes that have deepened the memories of all who had catched a glimpse on this game. But what if things can go further? 10 people in a single session? Online PVP exprience? Custom server setup and the abilty to customize contents as one's wish? This is the main objective that I have always wanted to achieve, bringing ZUN's Gensokyo to every corner of (currently) PCs and customize their favourite versions.

(Of course, things must be stay in its order, and everything must be constrainted in [this guideline](https://touhou-project.news/guidelines_en/)).

```js
console.log('Hi');
